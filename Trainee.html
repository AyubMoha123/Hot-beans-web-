<h2>   Trainee Profile 1: Sophia Williams – Web Developer Trainee</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Hi, I’m Sophia Williams, and I joined Hot Beans Web Development as a Web Developer Trainee in January 2024. Before starting here, I completed an online coding bootcamp and built several personal projects, including a portfolio website and a task management app. Since joining the team, I’ve been working primarily on the front-end, focusing on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create beautiful, responsive websites. I’ve also started to get involved in React development and have been learning about API integration. The best part of my role has been the opportunity to work on real-world projects. For example, I’m currently working on the front-end for a non-profit organization’s website. I’ve received great feedback from my mentors, and it’s been incredibly rewarding to see my work come to life. My goal is to continue building my skills in web development and eventually specialize in user interface (UI) design and front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js.

    Hey, I’m Luke Anderson, and I’m a Web Developer Trainee at Hot Beans. I joined the company in February 2024 after graduating with a degree in Computer Science. Since joining, I’ve been working on both front-end and back-end development, using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. I’ve been part of several projects, including building a content management system (CMS) for a client, where I learned a lot about database management and API development. I’m passionate about learning new technologies, and I’ve already started exploring serverless architecture and cloud technologies like AWS. My time at Hot Beans has been great for developing my technical skills and learning how to work as part of a development team. I’m really looking forward to continuing my training and becoming a fully-fledged web developer.</p>
    
    <h2> Trainee profile 2: Sophia Patel Front End Developer</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Hi, I’m Sofia Patel, a front-end development trainee at Hot Beans. My journey into web development began after I transitioned from a career in graphic design. I’ve always had a passion for blending creativity with technology, which led me to pursue web design and, eventually, front-end development. I’ve been working with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React, and I love the challenge of building responsive, visually appealing websites that deliver great user experiences. Currently, I’m involved in creating user interfaces for client projects, ensuring that the websites are not only functional but also aligned with the clients’ branding. One of my proudest accomplishments so far has been working on a client portal that simplified the user registration and login process. I’m always learning and growing through hands-on experience, and my mentor, a senior front-end developer, has been an amazing guide. They’ve taught me the importance of accessibility, cross-browser compatibility, and adhering to best practices in UI/UX design. As I continue my training, I’m excited to dive deeper into React and experiment with Vue.js, and I hope to eventually take on more back-end responsibilities. My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer, where I can contribute to both the front-end and back-end of web applications.

        </h2>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, I’m Amir Khan, a full-stack development trainee here at Hot Beans. I’ve always been fascinated by software engineering, and after earning my degree, I decided to focus on web development. I enjoy the versatility of full-stack development because it allows me to work on both the front-end and back-end of applications. I’ve been working withReact,Node.js,Express, and databases likeSQLandNoSQL, and I love the challenge of creating end-to-end solutions. One of the projects I’ve worked on is a customer relationship management (CRM) tool, where I developed both the front-end user interface and back-end API integrations. It’s been exciting to see how everything connects together and how the user experience is shaped by both the design and the underlying architecture. I’ve been fortunate to have a mentor who is a senior full-stack developer, and their guidance has been invaluable. They’ve helped me improve my coding practices, understand cloud deployment withAWSandHeroku, and explore new technologies likeGraphQL. In the future, I want to continue mastering both front-end and back-end technologies, and I hope to lead full-stack projects at Hot Beans, driving innovation and creating high-impact web applications.,</p>
